### My Changes:

I have created a product component to make sure easy to update and maintain. Also, I added style file to extend and overwrite some of the bootstrap styling. This approach simplifies responsiveness and allows for easy rearrangement of elements at different breakpoints. I ensured consistent spacing and alignment by using grid-gap and relative units.
